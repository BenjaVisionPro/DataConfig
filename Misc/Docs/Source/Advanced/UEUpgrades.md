# Unreal Engine Upgrades

DataConfig is committed to support multiple UE versions with no deprecations and warnings. On this page we'll document important upgrade and migration info.

# UE5.5

- A new series batch scripts under `Engine/Build/BatchFiles/RunUBT` is added which will will do a bunch of checks before running `UnrealBuildTool`.
  One should now use `RunUBT` instead of `UnrealBuildTool` otherwise it won't work in some configuration.
- `EAutomationTestFlags` is now a `enum class` type.
- `TIsTriviallyDestructible` is deprecated over `std::is_trivially_destructible_v`.
- `TFieldPath(OtherPropertyType*)` constructor now checks for actual type safety.
- `FProperty::ElementSize` deprecated over `GetElementSize`.
- `StructUtils` plugin is deprecated with all things moved in engine.
- `PER_MODULE_BOILERPLATE` not needed anymore as UBT handles it automatically.
- `FVerseValueProperty` renamed to `FVValueProperty`, also compiled only with `WITH_VERSE_VM` define.

# UE5.4
- New property `Optional` and `VValue` are added. We fully support `Optional` starting by adding `EDcDataEntry::OptionalRoot/OptionalEnd` and then evantually it works with all DataConfig APIs including JSON/MsgPack serialization and property builder. 
- `FObjectPtrProperty/FClassPtrProperty` are deprecated. It's introduced in 5.0 now removed and alias to `FObjectProperty/FClassProperty` respectively.
- Defaults to MSVC `\W4` flag now which checks for unreachable code. It reports confusing locations and you can set `bUseUnity = false` in your `*.Build.cs` module rules to locate whereabout.
- `FText` internal pointer changed from `TSharedRef` to `TRefCountPtr`.

# UE5.3

* Introduces `BuildSettingsVersion.V4` which now defaults to C++ 20.
* `TRemoveConst` is deprecated over `std::remove_const`.
* `FScriptDelegate` etc now has additional checkers based on threading model and debug/release build. Thus we change how `FScriptDelegateAccess` works.

# UE5.2

* `TIsSame` is deprecated over `std::is_same`.
* In `Build.cs` `bEnforceIWYU` is changed to enum `IWYUSupport`.

# UE5.1

* UE5.1 deprecates `ANY_PACKAGE` in favor of a new method `FindFirstObject`. In DataConfig we provided `DcSerdeUtils::FindFirstObject` which calls `FindObject(ANY_PACKAGE)` pre 5.1 and calls `FindFirstObject()` for 5.1 and onwards. 

# UE5.0

* New [`TObjectPtr`][2] to replace raw UObject pointers. Turns out this is mostly handled within the engine and is transparent to DataConfig.

* New property types `FObjectPtrProperty` and `FClassPtrProperty` are added. They're handled the same as `FObjectProperty` and `FClassProperty` respectively.

* `FVector` now is 3 `double`s, and `Real` data type in Blueprint now is also double. This is also mostly transparent to DataConfig.

* `FScriptArrayHelperAccess` size changes with a added `uint32 ElementAlignment`.

* `TStringBuilderWithBuffer` API changes. At call sites we now do `Sb << TCHAR('\n')` instead of `Sb.Append(TCHAR('\n'))` .

# UE4

* The oldest version DataConfig supports is UE 4.25, in which it [introduces a major refactor][1] that changes `UProperty` to `FProperty`. We intended to support UE4 in the foreseeable future, especially when we now have separated `uplugin` for UE4 and UE5.
